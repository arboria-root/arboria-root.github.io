        <h1>About Arboria</h1>

        <p><strong>Arboria</strong> is a massively multiplayer online
        interactive fiction adventure. The choices you make determine the story
        you tell. And, if your story reaches a dead-end, we invite <em>you</em>
        to continue writing it for future Arborians to explore. Arboria's story
        grows and branches like a tree (dare we say, <em>arboreally?</em>),
        sprawling across the Internet of personal websites.

        <hr/>

        <p>Arboria relies on writers like you to continue the tale. Throughout
        Arboria, you will a find links like this one:

        <p><a href="arboria.html">Continue the tale!</a>

        <p>Such links take you to the page owner's <code>arboria.html</code>
        page, which lists their contact information, and anything else they
        want a potential writer to know. When you have finished writing,
        contact the owner so that they can link that page to your continuation.

        <p>If you have gotten here by clicking such a link, read on for
        information on how to write Arboria pages, as well as my contact
        information.

        <h2>Writing Arboria</h2>

        <p><em>Arboria pages are just normal webpages.</em> This means that you
        can use any website generator (such as Weebly or DreamWeaver), blogging
        software (such as Tumblr or WordPress), or even a Wiki to create your
        Arboria pages. If you are familiar with HTML, you can even code your
        Arboria pages from scratch.
        
        <p>You can upload your Arboria pages to your own personal website, or
        choose from a variety of free hosts on the Internet. If you need any
        help with this, feel free to contact me.

        <p>Each Arboria page should have some textual description and one or
        more links giving your reader options on how to proceed. Beyond that,
        though, your Arboria pages are your own to present. You can format them
        any way you wish.
        
        <p>Artists, feel free to use colorful illustrations to enhance the
        readers&rsquo; experience. Programmers, feel free to serve dynamic
        Arboria pages that change depending on the time of the day. I only
        request that your pages try to be accessible to most browsers and
        screenreaders&mdash;a simple test is that your pages should be usable
        for someone who disables JavaScript or CSS.

        <p>You should always have an <code>arboria.html</code> page with
        contact information, so that your readers can continue your story even
        farther. Of course, this means you should leave some of your storylines
        open-ended by adding <em>Continue the tale!</em> links in some places.
        Whether or not to link to someone's page is entirely at your
        discretion, but I encourage you to be generous in this. It is, after
        all, a great honor to have your story continued by a stranger.

        <h2>Contact me</h2>

        <p>If you are a Github user, the easiest way to reach me is to <a
        href="https://github.com/arboria-root/arboria-root.github.io/issues/new">open
        an issue</a> on Arboria's repository. There's a nice template to guide
        you through everything.

        <p>Otherwise, you can email me directly at the address <code>contact
        (a) comfortably numbered (.) app spot mail (.) com</code> &mdash; no
        spaces, of course.

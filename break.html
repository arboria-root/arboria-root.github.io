        <h1>Breaking the Window</h1>
        
        <p>The window smashes gracefully; the shattering sound is surprisingly
        satisfying to you. You realize, in the back of your mind, that you
        somewhat enjoyed that act of vandalism. You vault yourself over the
        windowsill and hop off onto the floor.
        
        <p>The floor stubbornly refuses to meet your feet. 
        
        <p>You first realize something is wrong about a second in, when you
        notice that you are still falling. You consider panicking, then choose
        instead to enjoy the ride. Another second goes by, then you land
        clumsily on a small cot covered with shards of glass and a brick.
        
        <p>The only illumination is from the few rays of sunlight that stream
        pitifully through the window you broke&mdash;you can see the beams stab
        through the cloud of dust rising gently above you. But even in the
        darkness, you can see the grimy brick walls and cold stone floor that
        contain you.
        
        <p>You do not know what to call your surroundings. Basement? Dungeon?
        Badly-designed conversation pit? After a brief internal debate, you
        decide to go with "dungeon", since it has that dungeon-ey ambiance.
        
        <hr/>
        
        <p>A curtain hangs through an arched doorway, its sardonic floral print
        offending the interior decorator within you. A wooden ladder leans
        precariously against the opposite wall. Spiderwebs span the spaces
        between the rungs, and you try not to imagine what other arthropods
        might be lurking around you.
        
        <p>You begin to regret jumping through the window.

        <h1>Behind the Curtain</h1>
        
        <p>You find yourself in a chamber virtually identical to the one you
        were just in, but somehow manages to be even dustier, grimier, and
        grimmer.  You start sighing, then think better of it&mdash;that dust
        cannot possibly be good for your lungs.
        
        <p>On the bright side, however&mdash;and it really is the bright
        side&mdash;it's not as dark in this chamber. Indeed, the chamber is
        bathed in a sickly yellow that seems to be emanating from &hellip; come
        to think of it, you're not quite sure where the glow is coming from.
        
        <p>You venture deeper into the chamber, wading through the opaque
        clouds of dust, and realize it is much larger than you thought. You
        guess the direction of the glow from your shadow and start walking. You
        cannot see more than an arm's length through the dust; occasionally you
        bump into a wall and have to turn.
        
        <hr/>
        
        <p>It's a light bulb. When you're close enough, the glow sharpens to
        a halo, and then to a blazing arc of filament.
        
        <p>You look up, but thanks to the dust, you cannot see where the bulb
        is suspended from.
        
        <p>You look down, and you see footprints.
        
        <p>The footprints interest you for two reasons. Firstly, there are two
        sets: your own, and those of a bare foot at least two shoe sizes larger
        than yours. The second reason is that both sets of footprints arrive at
        the light bulb; neither leave.
        
        <p>As you try to puzzle this out in your mind, you become aware of a
        wailing sound echoing through the chamber. As you begin to focus on it,
        you realized you judged it prematurely. It's not wailing; it's someone
        singing.
        
        <p>You try to think of an excuse for being where you are. Falling
        serendipitiously through a conveniently-broken window seems like a
        stretch, so you choose instead to hide behind a nearby wall.
        
        <p>The singing gets louder, but you still cannot discern the words.

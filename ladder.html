        <h1>Climbing the Ladder</h1>
        
        <p>You take a tentative step up the ladder, and it seems to hold your
        weight. You take another step, and then another. Halfway up the ladder,
        you can see the inside of the boarded-up door. You begin to realize
        that there is a small flaw in your plan, but you decide to cross that
        bridge when it comes.
        
        <p>You reach the top of the ladder and stare at the door. Frustrated,
        you throw your fists at it in futility.
        
        <p><em>&mdash; Who's there?</em> calls a sing-song voice, almost
        knocking you off the ladder in surprise. You grip the top rung tighter.
        
        <p><em>&mdash; Help! Open the door!</em> you cry, louder than you need
        to.
        
        <p><em>&mdash; Nuh-uh! Sor-ry!</em> says the sing-song voice. You hear
        faint laughter on the other side.
        
        <hr/>
        
        <p>You try to evaluate your position. Strategically, you decide, you
        are losing, considering (a) you're on top of a tall, flimsy ladder, and
        (b) you have no idea what you are doing.
        
        <p>You deduce that you are in no way prepared to go on the offensive.
        You thus do the honorable thing and descend the ladder as quickly as
        you can.

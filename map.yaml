    text: |
        <p>Intrigued, you pry open the rusty mailbox with great difficulty. Out
        comes a small letter, folded hastily in half. It reads, in rushed
        handwriting,

        <blockquote>

        <p>Welcome to Arboria!

        <p>To learn more about the world you're in, click <a
        href="arboria.html">here</a>.

        <p>We hope you enjoy your stay.

        </blockquote>

        <p>The letter ends as abruptly as it begins. You silently fold it back
        and return it to the mailbox, which squeals in pain as you close it.

        <hr/>

        <p>To the west is an old house with a boarded-up door.
        
        <p>To the east is a vast field clothed in the verduous, lush grass. The
        sun is in your eyes, but if you squint, you think can see some trees in
        the distance.

    knock.html: Knock on the door.
    east.html: Head east.

        <p>You begin on the long journey eastwards. You choose not to look back
        behind you as you trudge silently across the grass, hearing only the
        occasional chirp above you.

        <p>The sun traverses the cloudless sky inch by inch, shortening your
        shadow as the hours flow by. By the time the trees in the distance
        begin to feel nearer, the sunshine is directly overhead. You pause to
        take a break. The grass is still cool and inviting, dotted with
        dandelions. You close your eyes for a moment.

        <hr/>

        <p>Tangerine hues bleed across the sky like watercolor on tissue paper.
        Venus stares intently at you through the clouds&hellip; and appears to
        jitter a little.

        <p>Actually, now that you think about it, the entire sky is shaking, as
        are the trees in the distance. On closer inspection, it is <em>you</em>
        who is moving. You hazard looking down, only to see the grass gone. It
        has been replaced with a meager pile of hay heaped on wood.

        <p>You take stock of the situation and conclude that you are on a
        horse-drawn cart racing east. Your arms are tied behind you
        uncomfortably, but posture appears to be the least of your worries at
        the moment.
        
        <p>Your stomach grumbles audibly.

        <p><em>&mdash; Hello! Hello! Where am I?</em>

        <p><em>&mdash; Don't move.</em>

        <p><em>&mdash; Where are we going?</em>

        <p><em>&mdash; You know very well where you are going.</em>

        <p><em>&mdash; Is this some sort of joke?</em>

        <p><em>&mdash; Does this look like a joke to you?</em> The cart driver
        stops the cart suddenly; it lurches and your head collides painfully
        with the wood. He dismounts and walks around to look you in the eye. He
        is tall, with long hair ruffled messily by the windy ride. <em>Who do
        you think you are?</em>

        <p><em>&mdash; There must be some mistake. I don't know what's
        happening.</em>

        <p><em>&mdash; The Queen will be the judge of that</em> says the driver
        harshly. You decide you don't like him very much.

        <p><em>&mdash; Fine. Take me to this Queen of yours. And get a
        haircut.</em> You realize this last outburst was a mistake before it
        even leaves your mouth. The driver glares at you in consternation,
        before wordlessly returning to his horses and resuming the ride.

        <p>With great effort, you heave yourself off the cart. Even before you
        land on the ground, you regret it. You land on your back, and roll a
        good distance before finally stopping.

        <p>The cart driver doesn't seem to notice your absence. He keeps
        driving along happily, and is soon out of sight in the distance.

        <p>You struggle to your feet and take in your surroundings. A small
        village, complete with dirt roads and thatched huts. Your back is
        extremely sore; your arms are still bound behind you.

        <p>You walk to the nearest hut and stand there for a moment wondering
        how to knock without your arms. You consider tapping the door lightly
        with your head, but before you have the chance to embarrass yourself
        that way, an old lady holding a rolling pin opens the door.

        <p><em>&mdash; Good evening, Ma'am.</em> you begin, formally. She looks
        at you like you're crazy, and you realize she has a good point. You
        gesture towards your bound hands, and she seems to understand. She
        turns and shouts into the hut in a strident voice and a foreign
        language.

        <p>A young boy, no taller than the old woman, returns with a serrated
        knife which, like all knives, looked bigger and sharper than it was.
        You panic for a moment, then realize her intentions and turn around.
        The ropes are sawed in seconds; you look at her with gratitude, unsure
        of how to express it.

        <p>She understands your expression and invites you inside. You
        graciously accept and enter the small mud hut just as the last bit of
        sun melts away over the horizon.

    title: Knocking at the Door
    text: |
        <p>You knock on the door, hesitantly at first, then more firmly when
        nobody answers. After a few moments of silence, you begin to realize
        the irony of knocking at a boarded-up door. You stand there sheepishly.

        <p>Determined to enter the house, you walk around its perimeter,
        searching for another way in. Paint peels grotesquely off the walls,
        and you wonder how old the house is. On the western side, ivy meanders
        up a corner, trying to engulf the house in a blanket of leaf.
        
        <p>You catch a glint of sunlight peeking through the ivy. Brushing
        aside the tangle of vegetation reveals a window webbed with cracks.

        <p>You notice a brick lying on the ground, almost as if it were left
        there just for you&hellip;

        <p>As you pick up the brick, your conscience begins to catch up to you.

    title: Breaking the Window
    text: |
        <p>The window smashes gracefully; the shattering sound is surprisingly
        satisfying to you. You realize, in the back of your mind, that you
        somewhat enjoyed that act of vandalism. You vault yourself over the
        windowsill and hop off onto the floor.

        <p>The floor stubbornly refuses to meet your feet. 

        <p>You first realize something is wrong about a second in, when you
        notice that you are still falling. You consider panicking, then choose
        instead to enjoy the ride. Another second goes by, then you land
        clumsily on a small cot covered with shards of glass and a brick.
        
        <p>The only illumination is from the few rays of sunlight that stream
        pitifully through the window you broke&mdash;you can see the beams stab
        through the cloud of dust rising gently above you. But even in the
        darkness, you can see the grimy brick walls and cold stone floor that
        contain you.

        <p>You do not know what to call your surroundings. Basement? Dungeon?
        Badly-designed conversation pit? After a brief internal debate, you
        decide to go with "dungeon", since it has that dungeon-ey ambiance.

        <hr/>

        <p>A curtain hangs through an arched doorway, its sardonic floral print
        offending the interior decorator within you. A wooden ladder leans
        precariously against the opposite wall. Spiderwebs span the spaces
        between the rungs, and you try not to imagine what other arthropods
        might be lurking around you.

        <p>You begin to regret jumping through the window.

    title: Behind the Curtain
    text: |
        <p>You find yourself in a chamber virtually identical to the one you
        were just in, but somehow manages to be even dustier, grimier, and
        grimmer.  You start sighing, then think better of it&mdash;that dust
        cannot possibly be good for your lungs.

        <p>On the bright side, however&mdash;and it really is the bright
        side&mdash;it's not as dark in this chamber. Indeed, the chamber is
        bathed in a sickly yellow that seems to be emanating from &hellip; come
        to think of it, you're not quite sure where the glow is coming from.

        <p>You venture deeper into the chamber, wading through the opaque
        clouds of dust, and realize it is much larger than you thought. You
        guess the direction of the glow from your shadow and start walking. You
        cannot see more than an arm's length through the dust; occasionally you
        bump into a wall and have to turn.

        <hr/>

        <p>It's a light bulb. When you're close enough, the glow sharpens to
        a halo, and then to a blazing arc of filament.

        <p>You look up, but thanks to the dust, you cannot see where the bulb
        is suspended from.

        <p>You look down, and you see footprints.

        <p>The footprints interest you for two reasons. Firstly, there are two
        sets: your own, and those of a bare foot at least two shoe sizes larger
        than yours. The second reason is that both sets of footprints arrive at
        the light bulb; neither leave.

        <p>As you try to puzzle this out in your mind, you become aware of a
        wailing sound echoing through the chamber. As you begin to focus on it,
        you realized you judged it prematurely. It's not wailing; it's someone
        singing.

        <p>You try to think of an excuse for being where you are. Falling
        serendipitiously through a conveniently-broken window seems like a
        stretch, so you choose instead to hide behind a nearby wall.

        <p>The singing gets louder, but you still cannot discern the words.

    title: Climbing the Ladder
    text: |
        <p>You take a tentative step up the ladder, and it seems to hold your
        weight. You take another step, and then another. Halfway up the ladder,
        you can see the inside of the boarded-up door. You begin to realize
        that there is a small flaw in your plan, but you decide to cross that
        bridge when it comes.

        <p>You reach the top of the ladder and stare at the door. Frustrated,
        you throw your fists at it in futility.

        <p><em>&mdash; Who's there?</em> calls a sing-song voice, almost
        knocking you off the ladder in surprise. You grip the top rung tighter.

        <p><em>&mdash; Help! Open the door!</em> you cry, louder than you need
        to.

        <p><em>&mdash; Nuh-uh! Sor-ry!</em> says the sing-song voice. You hear
        faint laughter on the other side.

        <hr/>

        <p>You try to evaluate your position. Strategically, you decide, you
        are losing, considering (a) you're on top of a tall, flimsy ladder, and
        (b) you have no idea what you are doing.

        <p>You deduce that you are in no way prepared to go on the offensive.
        You thus do the honorable thing and descend the ladder as quickly as
        you can.

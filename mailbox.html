        <h1>The Mailbox</h1>
        
        <p>Intrigued, you pry open the rusty mailbox with great difficulty. Out
        comes a small letter, folded hastily in half. It reads, in rushed
        handwriting,
        
        <blockquote>
        
        <p>Welcome to Arboria!
        
        <p>To learn more about the world you're in, click <a
        href="arboria.html">here</a>.
        
        <p>We hope you enjoy your stay.
        
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The letter ends as abruptly as it begins. You silently fold it back
        and return it to the mailbox, which squeals in pain as you close it.
        
        <hr/>
        
        <p>To the west is an old house with a boarded-up door.
        
        <p>To the east is a vast field clothed in the verduous, lush grass. The
        sun is in your eyes, but if you squint, you think can see some trees in
        the distance.

        <h1>Dinner with the Floyds</h1>
        
        <p>For a moment, it is quiet around the table. Then, for the first
        time, the young boy speaks.
        
        <p><em>&mdash; Are you from far, sir?</em>
        
        <p>He looks into your eyes with understanding, and now the wall between
        you and the family has fallen and all that is left is for you to
        explain yourself.
        
        <p>And you do. The young boy nods along between bites of rice&mdash;it
        is a humble meal, but one you appreciate&mdash;and once or twice he
        turns to his mother to explain what you have said.</p>
        
        <p>Your tale approaches the present, and you stop suddenly, unsure of
        how to conclude. The young boy finishes for you,
        
        <p><em>&mdash; And now, sir, you are here with us.</em>
        
        <p>You wonder how such a young boy can act with such grace.
